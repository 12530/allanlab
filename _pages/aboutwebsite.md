# Make your own Jekyll website for an academic research group

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootstrap. 

If you never used Jekyll, here is a tutorial on how to set it up locally (hoting is easier using the Github desktop app, in my opinion). After you familiarized yourself with Jekyll and Github, just fork our page, and you are welcom to use and modify it. You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).
