# Make your own Jekyll website for an academic research group

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. 

If you never used Jekyll, [here is a tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) on how to set it up locally (tranferring it to Github is easier using the Github desktop app, in my opinion). After you familiarized yourself with Jekyll and Github, just fork our page, and you are welcome to use and modify it. 

All pages are written in markdown for easy editing, and Jekyll uses Liquid for the data-driven pages. The publicaion list, news items, and group members are stored as *.yml* data sheets (plain text). Look at our website to see how it works.

For publications, you can add a "1" in the highlight field, then it will be fratured prominently. You can add important  news items (red, "news1"), and less important  news items (blue, "news2").

For the news items, just keep adding them. The first 10 will be displayed on the 'home' page.

For the authors

You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).
