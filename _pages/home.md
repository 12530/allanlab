<firstp> We are a small, dynamic group at Leiden University, with the aim is to explore and understand quantum materials, including strange metals, hight-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. </firstp>

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools, and use those to visualise the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want do be able to build the perfect instruments in order to answer the most important scientific questions.

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Onnes, Lorenz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from Quantum Matter & Optics ,as well as with the  colleagues form the world-class theory section.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an email. State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/master](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/master).


We are grateful for funding from Leiden University and NWO (thought a _Vidi talent grant_ and the _Frontiers in Nanoscience program_).
